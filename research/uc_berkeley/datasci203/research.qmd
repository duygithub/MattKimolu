# Overview

Swimming is an important life skill and can prevent a significant number of childhood deaths[^1]. Swimming is also a great life-long sport[^2] [^3]. Competitive swimming can help with academic achievement[^4] and develop important skills like stress management, interpersonal harmony, and goal management[^5]. This study provies an explanatory framework to help young competitive swimmers swim breaststroke faster.

@Craig1979 published sports biomechanics research to help improve individual swimming athlete's performance in 1979 and included the formula

$$
Velocity = Stroke Rate \times Stroke Length
$$

The study claims velocity $V$ increased as a result of increasing the stroke rate $S_R$ and decreasing the stroke length $S_L$ for all four competitive strokes. @Vorontsov1991 published research that male swimmers ages 11-15 should focus more on $S_L$. In a follow-up study, @Vorontsov2002 published findings that maintaining a long $S_L$ is a key factor in improving performance for younger swimmers, especially before they turn 11-12 because that's when the individual swimming rhythm is largely established.

There is no peer-reviewed research relating to stroke length of swimmers under 10-years-old despite competitive multi-city competitions available for 6-year-olds with multi-state Age Group Zones (AGZ) Championships for 10-year-olds. Many of these studies are done in meter courses wheras many competitions in the US are done in shorter yard courses.

Special camera equipment is needed to calculate $S_R$ and $S_L$ requires, which we do not have access to. Therefore, we will make use of the proxy, Stroke Count ($S_C$) per lap. $S_C$ is proportional to $S_R$ and inversely proportional to $S_L$. Accounting for the glide distance (how far the swimmer is able to dive and swim underwater or kick off the wall and swim underwater),

![Glide Distance and Stroke Count from @Mediterraswim2019](glide_distance_pool_length.png){#fig-glide_distance_pool_length}

the relationship between $S_L$ and $S_C$ is

$$
StrokeLength=\frac{PoolLength-GlideDistance}{StrokeCount}
$$

This study aims to identify the ideal $S_C$ to minimize the time it takes to complete a lap $T_{lap}$, measured in milliseconds. We want to provide a framework that can be used to provide analysis for individual swimmers as young as 6-years-old who have demonstrated a sufficient mastery of the stroke (they are not disqualified at a sanctioned swim meet for the stroke) and is useful for swimmers under 11-years-old.

This initial study is exclusively on the breaststroke though its methodologies can be applied to other competitive strokes. The metric is selected for the US, though the framework can be extended to international swimming pools. The primary audience will be individuals working with swimmers under 11-year-olds, though the data collection and analysis can be enhanced for older swimmers.

# Experiment Design

## Measurement Metric

There are two type of courses in competitive swimming: long course and short course. Olympic competition happens in long course format where each lap is 50 meters (LCM). Internationally, short courses are 25 meters (SCM) (so 1 LCM = 2 x SCM). In the US, most competitive swimming up through college uses 25-yard short courses (SCY) and 50-meter long courses (LCM), (so 1 LCM \~=2.18722 SCY). This experiment is designed with SCY.

## Selection of Events

Given this study focuses on breaststroke for swimmers under 11-years-old in the US, there are several competitive events that we can study

::: {tbl-colwidths="[40,60]"}
| **Event** | **Note** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 25 Breaststroke SCY | Only for swimmers under 9 years old |
| 50 Breaststroke SCY | |
| 50 Breaststroke LCM | |
| 100 Breaststroke SCY | |
| 100 Breaststroke LCM | |
| 100 Individual Medley SCY | |
| 200 Individual Medley SCY | |
| 200 Individual Medley LCM | |
: US Competitive Events with Breaststroke for Swimmers Under 11 Years Old {#tbl-competitive_event_with_breastroke}
:::

For US non-collegiate swimming, LCM courses are mostly only available during summer sessions, so we only conduct our study in SCY. An Individual Medley (IM) is where the swimmer swims all four strokes and is the second most physically demanding swim allowed for swimmers under 9 years old(e.g., a 100 FR is the only more demanding swim than a 100 IM [@BarbosaEnergetics]). Therefore, it would be too physically demanding for an 8-year-old to continuously swim 200 IM SCY. Finally, we exclude a 100 BR SCY because of time constraints as breaststroke is, by far, the slowest of the competitive strokes. The events that we will conduct the tests are:

* 25 BR SCY
* 50 BR SCY
* 100 IM SCY

## Rest Times

The swimmer will be fatigued after each swim event. For us to conduct our study, we must give the swimmer adequate time to rest between each timed event. @NeivaPassiveRest recommends 10 minutes of passive recovery for a 200 FR SCM and not to exceed 20 minutes. We can use this study as a baseline for rest time because @RatelMetabolicProfile observed that prepubertal children have recovery profiles comparable to well-trained adult endurance athletes (given that our population are competitive prepubertal children, we expect them to have faster recovery times that average prepubertal children.) For our experiment, we will implement the following rest times:

| **Event** | **Target Rest Time** | **Reason** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 100 IM SCY | 10 minutes | The 100 IM is more challenging than a 100 FR. However, @NeivaPassiveRest conducted a study with 200 FR, so a 10 minute rest is reasonable . |
| 50 BR SCY | 5 minutes | This swim is 1/2 the length an IM and a BR requires the least energy output [@KachunovEnergetics]. |
| 25 BR SCY | 3 minutes | This swim is 1/4 the length an IM and a BR requires the least energy output [@KachunovEnergetics]. |

# Model Building

## Causal Theory and Hypothesis

We opt for the explanatory mode for model building because we are primarily interested in deriving $S_C$. We want to determine what causal relationship, if any, exists between selecting a specific $S_C$ and its effect on $T_{lap}$. This leads us to our null hypothesis:

> **$H_0$**: There is no relationship between $S_C$ and $T_{lap}$.


## Interaction Terms
Our linear model make use of dummy / indicator variables to account for the optimal $S_C$ being different for the 50 BR SCY and 100 IM SCY because of the following considerations:

* Fatigue is especially pronounced in an IM race where breaststroke is the third leg of the race where the swimmer has expended a significant amount of energy. The swimmer must also reserve the energy for the last stroke of the race, freestyle, where the swimmer is expected to sprint because freestyle is the fastest of the four strokes.
* Turn and pullout distances are important because they will determine how much of the lap the swimmer has to swim. The ensuing turn and pullout distances will always be slower than the original start distance because the swimmer is jumping into the water as opposed to swimming in the water.

It's clear that $S_C$ for any subsequent lap is not independent of $S_C$ for the previous lap because a higher $S_C$ in the previous lap would require more energy, resulting in a more fatigued swimmer in subsequent laps. This implies that at least one interaction term is required.

**TBD: Figure out interaction terms**

## Linear Regression Model

Our regression model is defined as

$$
T_{lap} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 S_C + \beta_2 I_{50\_BR\_SCY} + \beta_3 I_{100\_IM\_SCY} + \epsilon
$$

::: {tbl-colwidths="[20,80]"}
| Variable | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| $T_{lap}$ | The timing of how long it took for the swimmer to complete the breastroke swim. For the data entry of types 25 and 50L1, this is the time it takes the swimmer to swim the first lap. For 50L2, this is the time it takes the swimmer to swim the second lap. For 100IM, this is the time it takes for the swimmer to swim the breaststroke leg of the IM.
| $\beta_0$ | This is the time needed to travel the entire distance of the first lap, assuming no stroke is taken. This is theoretically achievable for any stroke in a 25 SCY, 25 SCM, and 50 LCM scenario by a swimmer diving in and gliding to the other side without taking a single stroke. The values are in milliseconds. |
| $\beta_1$ | The increase or decrease in time for each stroke the swimmer takes. |
| $S_C$ | The stroke count that the swimmer takes for the given leg. |
| $\beta_2$ | This operationalizes the combined lap penalty of a 50 SCY where the swimmer has to turn and pullout (which will always be slower than a good dive and start pullout) and fatigue from the previous lap. |
| $I_{50\_BR\_SCY}$ | An indicator variable; 1 if this is the 2nd leg of a 50 Breaststroke SCY event and 0 otherwise. |
| $\beta_3$ | This operationalizes the combined lap penalty of a 100 IM where the swimmer has to turn and pullout (which will always be slower than a good dive and start pullout) and fatigue from swimming the previous two strokes. |
| $I_{100\_IM\_SCY}$ | An indicator variable; 1 if this is the breaststroke leg of a 100 Individual Medley SCY event and 0 otherwise. |
| $\epsilon$ | The residual of the actual observed time vs that predicted by the model. |
: Definition of Variables {#tbl-definition_of_variables}
:::

Once we've collected data outlined in @tbl-definition_input_parameters, we'll use the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method to calculate the vector **$\hat{\beta}$**, which contains all of our regression coefficients.

## Noted 

In our data collection, we note which session and ordinal within the session we collected the data because they might impact have a significant impact on $T_{lap}$.

Our model does not differentiate the data from a 25 SCY with a that of the first leg of a 50 SCY. We will note in our data collection if the data is from a 25 SCY or the first leg of a 50 SCY. We will have the swimmer swim both a 25 SCY and 50 SCY and use the data from the 25 SCY to help validate our baseline.

# Data

## Data Format

We will collect data in csv files with the title format YYYY_MM_DD_-8.csv where -8 is the current offset from GMT as defined below. Collecting the date and offset gives us resolution if we ever wanted to study effects of specific time of the year / month / week / day and ignore stale data.

| **Parameter** | **Use** |
| :--- | :--- |
| event_ordinal | The first event of the file is 1 and subsequent events are incremented by 1. |
| start_time | The local HH:mm:ss in 24-hour format. For multi-lap swim, this value is null. |
| elapsed_time | How long it took the swimmer to complete the lap with millisecond resolution. |
| stroke_count | The number of strokes the swimmer took to complete the lap. |
| data_entry_type | One of \{25, 50L1, 50L2, 100IM\} |

## Deriving Sample Size

### Exploratory Data Analysis

It's helpful to start with an exploratory data set to have a sense of the relationship between $S_C$ and $T_{lap}$. To start, we had one test subject swim 3 laps of 25 BR SCY at 10, 14, 17, 20, and 24 strokes with rest times defined by @tbl-rest_times. She will swim the strokes in increasing order of stroke counts, then decreasing, then increasing again.

The swimmer's name is Jadzia Bao Tran Vo (<https://www.swimcloud.com/swimmer/2555077/>) and is the daughter of Duy Bao Vo.

@fig-exploratory_data_stroke_count_elapsed_time_plot shows a bell-shaped curve so we use @tbl-summary_statistics_exploratory_data's sample $\bar{x}$ and $s$ to generate data with $N(\bar{x}, s)$. We ran `r power_analysis_simulation_count` simulations using @eq-linear_regression_model with the generated data and determined that our swimmer should swim at least `r power_analysis_data_size` laps to achieve a power of at least `r exploratory_data_power`.

## Data Collection

## Hypothesis Testing

## Deriving Optimal Stroke Count

Once we've collected the data and used OLS to calculate the regression coefficients, we end up with the equation

$$
\hat{T}_{lap} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 S_C + \hat{\beta}_2 I_{50\_BR\_SCY} + \hat{\beta}_3 I_{100\_IM\_SCY}
$$ {#eq-linear_regression_model} Linear Regression Model
Next, we group the times first by the Data Entry Type as defined in @tbl-definition_input_parameters

* 25 and 50L1 are grouped together
* 50L2
* 100IM

After the grouping by the Data Entry Type, we group by the stroke count so we can calculate the following statistic:

* mean ($\bar{x}$)
* median ($\tilde{x}$)
* fastest ($x_{fast}$)
* slowest ($x_{slow}$)
* sample standard deviation ($s$)

The optimal stroke count for each swimmer will also likely account for a swimmer's penchant for risk. For example, all of the following scenarios are possible for a given swimmer:

* $SC_1$ is associated with the two fastest times.
* $SC_2$ is associated with the fastest $\bar{x}$, but the third biggest $s$.
* $SC_3$ is associated with the second fastest $\bar{x}$, but the smallest $s$.

Once we've selected the $T_{Target}$, we calculate the optimal $S_C$ for each of the three scenarios:

$$
S_C = \frac{T_{Target} - \hat{\beta}_0}{\hat{\beta}_1}
$$ {#eq-optimal_stroke_count_25} Optimal Stroke Count for 25 BR SCY or First Leg of 50 BR SCY

$$
S_C = \frac{T_{Target} - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_2}{\hat{\beta}_1}
$$ {#eq-optimal_stroke_count_50} Optimal Stroke Count for Second Leg of 50 BR SCY

$$
S_C = \frac{T_{Target} - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_3}{\hat{\beta}_1}
$$ {#eq-optimal_stroke_count_100IM} Optimal Stroke Count for Breaststroke Leg of 100 IM SCY

### Limitation on Applicability to Individual Medley (IM) Events

IM's are inherently different from other competitive events because the swimmer must swim all four strokes. Swimmers' performance can vary significantly among different strokes. For example, Katie Ledecky, who holds the world record for most gold medals won by a female swimmer, has only ever swam freestyle events at the Olympics [@OlympicsLedecky]. Michael Phelps, who holds the world record for most gold medals won by a male swimmer [@OlympicsPhelps], has never swam an individual backstroke or breaststroke event at the Olympics [@OlympediaPhelpsIndividualEvents]. When optimizing for IM, it's important to consider the strengths of the swimmer, which is rarely breaststroke. For many swimmers, including Jadzia Vo, optimizing the breaststroke time in an IM will likely lead to a sub optimal overall IM time. However, this study does provide some value in helping determine an optimal IM strategy.

If we want to find the optimal $S_C$ for breaststroke that minimizes the overall 100 IM time, we'll need to have four regression models (one for each stroke), where $Ordinal_{lap}$ accounts for the order of the stroke in the event (e.g. butterfly is the first stroke so the swimmer is fresh and breaststroke is the third stroke so the swimmer is likely fatigued):
$$
T_{lap} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 S_C + \beta_2 Ordinal_{lap} + \epsilon
$$ {#eq-optimal_stroke_per_leg}

USA Swimming has a Power Point Calculator at <https://data.usaswimming.org/datahub/powerpointcalculator> for calculating the relative strengths of a swimmer's stroke across different events. There are some notable idiosyncrasies about the calculator:

* Age group ranges are defined by USA Swimming. For example, for 50 FR SCY, a 7-year-old and an 8-year-old will be compared together whereas a 9-year-old and a 10-year-old will be compared together. This means that a swimmer who just turned 7 yesterday will have their time compared with a swimmer who will turn 9 tomorrow, giving the latter swimmer an almost 2-year advantage in physical development and swim experience.
* There is no fraction, so we used \pm 6 months to determine the age.
* For events that there is no time standard (e.g. swimmers under 9 years old do not have time standards for a 500 FR SCY), they will be compared against the first group where the time standard applies. For example, a swimmer who turned 7 yesterday and swims a 500 FR SCY will be compared to a swimmer who will turn 11 tomorrow, giving the latter swimmer an almost 4-year advantage in physical development and swim experience.

We can use USA Swimming's Power Points to determine what is likely the swimmer's best stroke and prioritize those strokes when optimizing for an IM swim. We would then define the $T_{Target}$ for each stroke and find the corresponding $S_C$ for that stroke similar to @eq-optimal_stroke_count_25, @eq-optimal_stroke_count_50, and @eq-optimal_stroke_count_100IM.

: USA Swimming Power Points for Jadzia Vo {#tbl-power_points_jadzia_vo}

To optimize for the 100 IM SCY, we look at SCY data and it's obvious that Jadzia's breaststroke is the her weakest whereas her other three strokes are effectively equally strong. This would lead to choosing the fastest $T_{Target}$ defined by @eq-optimal_stroke_per_leg for the other three strokes. The challenge will be to find $T_{Target}$ for breaststroke (third leg) that is as fast as possible without materially impacting $T_{Target}$ for freestyle (fourth and final leg). Once we've defined $T_{Target}$ for breaststroke, we can use @eq-optimal_stroke_count_100IM to find $S_C$ for breaststroke that optimizes for the 100 IM.

# Future Work
We limited our study to SCY because that's the prevailing courses available during the time of the study in the US. We could expand the study to encompass LCM and SCM events and include much longer distance events like 400 IM LCM.

We also limited our study to breaststroke. There are three other competitive strokes we can analyze. We can then build four regression models to determine the optimal strategy for an IM.

Our study does not consider the psychological implication of swimming a single lap vs the first lap of a longer event. For example a swimmer who swims a 25 SCY might perform differently than the first leg of a 50 SCY. In theory, there should be no distinction. However, in practice, especially for younger swimmers, there might be a psychological difference between swimming a 25 SCY vs the first leg of a 50 SCY.

## Additional Variables
In addition to considering other strokes, there are additional variables that we would add to make this study more relevant to a wider population. We added these variables because we expect they can improve our model, but are not too onerous to collect.

| **Variable** | **Reason** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Age | Competitive swimming requires significant concentration to improve technique. Age is a proxy for maturity. This variable could be useful for selecting the optimal $S_C$ where associated with a high $s$ but fast $\bar{x}$ or $x_{fast}$. |
| Number of competitions | Good swimmers know their bodies and swim styles. The more experience they have at competition, the more ability they have to feel how their body interacts with water. This variable could be useful for selecting the optimal $S_C$ where associated with a high $s$ but fast $\bar{x}$ or $x_{fast}$.
| Glide time | This is an important consideration when trying to minimize $T_{lap}$. However, there are three distinct phases of the glide for breaststroke that deserves detailed analysis beyond scope of this study. |
